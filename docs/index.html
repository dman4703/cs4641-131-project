    <h1>Mean Reversion Trader</h1>
    <p class="author">

    </p>

    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>Mean reversion trading is based on the principle that prices tend to revert toward their average after 
        periods of overextension. To develop a consistent strategy, we leverage machine learning to make 
        predictions on market data while additionally optimizing performance for low-capital intraday trading.</p>

    <h3>Literature Review</h3>
    <p>
        Key features for mean reversion include VWAP, volume weighted average price, or "the price a 'naive' trader can expect to obtain," and 
        anchored VWAP (AVWAP), which tracks trend direction from a user‑set anchor point [1]. Bollinger Bands 
        provide secondary signals of overbought/oversold conditions through volatility envelopes [2]. The triple 
        barrier method labels trades realistically via profit‑taking, stop‑loss, and time limits [3], while 
        event‑based sampling reduces time‑bar heteroskedasticity [3].
    </p>

    <p>
        Gaussian mixture models can be used to determine probabilistic overextension scores from joint features, 
        and adapt better to regime shifts than z‑scores [4]. Random Forests handle nonlinear, correlated data well [5]; 
        paired with sequential bootstrap, there is less label‑overlap bias [3]. The probabilities output by this model
        indicate position sizes and whether to trade/not trade. Gradient‑boosted trees adapted for quantile 
        regression can be used for exit sizing by predicting conditional quantiles for dynamic stops and targets;
        they outperform classical methods in high‑dimensional settings [6][7].
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, model evaluation requires careful consideration. Traditional random test/train splits fail for 
        financial data because features and labels are serially correlated [3]. Purged k‑fold with embargo 
        removes overlap between samples, and combinatorial purged cross-validation (CPCV) returns a distribution of out‑of‑sample metrics from purged 
        k-fold, providing a more reliable measure of model performance [3].
    </p>

    <h3>Dataset Description</h3>
    <!-- TODO: update/revise as necessary. should list the 20 stocks that were selected.   -->
    <p>
        Quantitative, structured intraday time-series for 10–20 liquid U.S. equities (stock selection detailed 
        in Data Preprocessing), collected over 5 trading days during regular hours (excluding the first/last 
        5 minutes) from the Georgia Tech Bloomberg Terminal. These raw inputs consist of trades (price/size), 
        quotes (bid/ask and spread), and accumulated trading volume. We aggregate ticks into volume/dollar bars 
        to equalize information content. Derived features include AVWAP distance (z-score), Bollinger-band 
        position, short-term momentum, relative volume, and time-of-day. We (very tentatively) expect ~150–300 
        bars per session per ticker, totaling ~7.5k–30k bars. We will remove halts, out-of-sequence/duplicate 
        prints, and standardize per asset/session.

    <h2><u>Problem Definition</u></h2>

    <h3>Problem & Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional retail day trading strategies utilize naive heuristic rules that result in inconsistent 
        performance; this problem is amplified in low-capital accounts, where limited funds magnify risk and 
        reduce flexibility. We reinterpret the task as a machine learning problem: How can we better 
        distinguish true trading signals from market noise? Instead of doing subjective guesswork, we can 
        engineer event-based features, label outcomes, and train models. This way, we can realize profitable 
        outcomes with reliable, risk-adjusted performance using statistics rather than rule-of-thumb trading.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        Given an overextension event where price is far from an AVWAP, determine whether the price will revert 
        sufficiently within the next 15–30 minutes to yield a profitable mean‑reversion trade. If a profitable 
        reversion is likely, determine where to set dynamic take‑profit and stop‑loss levels to maximize 
        returns by predicting the distribution of return magnitudes and executing the trade accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Methods</u></h2>

    <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <!-- TODO: update/elaborate on the data preprocessing steps. needs to present and document 
     stock selection, data cleaning, bar construction, labeling, feature engineering, etc. include visuals. -->
    <p>TODO: update/elaborate on the data preprocessing steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Stock selection.</strong> For our universe, we will assume a trading capital of $2,500. 
            Stocks will be selected based on the following criteria:
            <ul>
                <li>Price band: $10–$100, so we can buy multiple lots without over-allocating capital.</li>
                <li>Liquidity: average daily volume in the upper 50 percentile.</li>
                <li>Volatility: moderate intraday movement, around 3-5%.</li>
                <li>Diversity: Selected from a variety of sectors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bar construction.</strong> Aggregate ticks into volume or dollar bars to normalize 
            information content.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature engineering.</strong> VWAP distance (expressed as a z-score), Bollinger position, 
            short‑term momentum, relative volume, time‑of‑day, and a five‑minute recent trading context feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization.</strong> Standardize per asset and per session for comparability.</li>
        <li><strong>Labeling.</strong> Triple‑barrier labels are used. A trade is successful if the price 
            reverts before the stop or time limit (15–30 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Splitting.</strong> Purged k‑fold with embargo to prevent information leakage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Models</h3>

    <h4>GMM: Unsupervised Overextension Detector</h4>
    <!-- TODO:  present/elaborate on the GMM model. discuss why we selected GMM. don't discuss results/evaluation here. 
     Do discuss the implementation details. hyperparameters, etc. can include relevant visuals. -->
    <p>TODO: present/elaborate on the GMM model.</p>
    <p>GMM on event features. Events whose log‑likelihood falls below a threshold are flagged as overextended candidates.</p>

    <h4>Supervised Opportunity Classifier</h4>
    <p>Random Forest trained on the overextension candidates; it outputs the probability of reversion.</p>

    <h4>Supervised Exit Model</h4>
    <p>Gradient‑boosted trees (trained on the events predicted to revert with high probability) to predict τ‑quantiles; we will use 
        the 0.1 quantile as the stop loss condition and the 0.5 quantile as the target condition.</p>

     GMM model. -->
